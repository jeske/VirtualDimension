Here are rough time estimations for all issues:

#001: 1.5 h,

#002: 2 h
(BTW, there are resource files for English and French in which dialog layouts duplicate, except strings, so adding a control etc. results in adding the same text twice... Maybe it worth refactoring this situation a bit or don't  support French so far?)

#003: 6h
A relatively large estimate because I couldn't reproduce this bug on my box, it may require testing on other systems. Probably it won't take so much

#004: 5h

#005: 1.5 h

#006: 3 h

#007: 3 h

#008: 6h
Not so straighforward, may require some investigation

#009: 4 h

#010: 9 h
(drag-n-drop in pure winapi, may take time to debug, although mostly implemented in the code)

#011: 4 h

#012: 8 h
(the task is somewhat large, but I already have an idea how to implement)

#013:
